PyClock

I originally made this as a large print clock so I could see what time it was without getting up close to my monitor (I'm mostly blind), then I may have gotten a bit carried away with colors and styles. LOL
I figured that more people could use it than just myself, so here it is.

Usage:

Launch the script using either the included PyClock.bat, call it from cmd.exe (or Terminal), or opening PyClock.py directly with Python (I recommend using PyClock.bat or calling it using cmd.exe or Terminal because opening PyClock.py directly in Python seems to cause flickering as the numbers refresh).

Upon opening, it'll ask for a number to choose the style: 1-5, and any other number will pick a value of 1-5 for you. Then depending on the choice, it'll ask you for another number to choose the amount of refreshes per second (higher is more accurate, but also more resource-intense): 1-30, and any other number will choose a value of 1-30 for you.

If you resize the window, be sure to leave a minimum of 1 column wider and one row taller than the numbers of the clock display, otherwise it breaks the display.

I hope it is useful for somebody.
